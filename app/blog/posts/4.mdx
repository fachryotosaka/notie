Hi Naa,

How have you been? I hope you're doing well. There are a few things I want to share with you, starting with a deep thank you for everything you've done for me. The good feelings you brought into my life are still with me, and I can't thank you enough for that.

Naa, I'm so grateful to have met you and to have had the chance to know you. You've given me so many good things, and I truly appreciate it. Thank you so much for falling in love with me and being a part of my life.

You know, Naa? My feelings for you haven't changed at all. I still love you deeply, miss you so much, and care for you more than ever. My feelings are real and genuine; I don't expect anything in return, except maybe the same feelings from you. These strong emotions have made me think about a lot of things, and I've realized so much.

Naa, I'm scared that I won't be good enough for you, that I can't give you everything you want or need. I'm worried that I won't be able to provide something more that you might be looking for. I know I'm not enough yet... We've always talked about so many dreams, right? But what if I can't make them come true? What if we just get stuck in this place? I'm afraid, Naa... Every day I think about it, "How long can we keep going?" I'm scared that I can't give you everything and that things might end badly. I have to try harder, more and more, Naa... But it's not easy for me, so I need to focus more on that. It hurts to think about letting you go.

Naa, you might end up hating me, but that's okay. I want to do what's best for you. I want to make the dreams you've shared with me come true. I want to be someone who brings good things into your life. I've never hated you; I still care about you deeply. I remember everything about you—what you like and don't like. I often dream about you, and it makes me feel so heavy inside. You probably never knew what was on my mind, right?

Naa, if one day your feelings for me are completely gone, or if you've found someone new who understands and loves you more, please don't talk about me. Just be happy; I'll be gone. I'll always wish the best for you, Naa. Thank you so much!

I'll always be here whenever you need me, I won't disappear, Naa.

I guess I’m just thinking I might not have another chance. But if we ever get back together, I promise I’ll make it up to you. I really hope that happens.

Hope we meet again, I think of you with every song I hear, with every star in the sky. Thank you so much! 

And if it really can’t be, thank you for having been a part of my life, for being my reason to live, my reason to smile, and my reason to become a better person. I hope you will always be well and that all your dreams come true.

*Sayonara my love.*

Do you know? I made this for you; it might seem strange seeing how we are, but believe me, it is valuable to me.

Here is the last flower from me. I hope it's not the final one. I wanted to give it to you in person, but since it's so difficult for us to meet, here is an online flower—yippee!! hehe
